### What is the primary key, and why is it important?
A primary key is a special relational database table column (or combination of columns) designated to uniquely identify all table records. It’s important for several reasons:
* Uniqueness: A primary key ensures that each record in the table is unique. This means that no two rows in the table can have the same primary key value.
* Data Integrity: By enforcing uniqueness, primary keys prevent duplicate entries and help to maintain data integrity.
* Relationships: Primary keys are often used to create relationships between tables. For example, a foreign key in one table could reference the primary key in another table, creating a link between the data in both tables.
* Efficient Data Retrieval: Databases are often optimized to search and sort by primary key, making data retrieval operations faster and more efficient.

### How do I choose the right primary key for my table?
Choosing the right primary key for your table is a critical step in database design. Here are some guidelines to help you make the right choice:
* Uniqueness: The primary key field must be unique for each record. It should not contain null values.
* Stability: Choose a primary key that doesn’t change. Updating primary keys can be problematic, especially if they’re used in foreign key relationships.
* Non-sensitive: Primary keys often appear in logs or other external systems, so they shouldn’t be sensitive or private data.
* Relevance: Although it’s tempting to use a field like ‘email’ or ‘username’ as a primary key for a Users table, it’s generally better to use an auto-incrementing ID or similar. This is because fields like ‘email’ or ‘username’ might change, breaking the Stability rule.

### What is the foreign key, and why is it important?
A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It acts as a cross-reference between tables because it references the primary key of another table, thereby establishing a link between them. Foreign keys play an essential role in database relationships, particularly in relation to maintaining the integrity of the data:
* Referential Integrity: Foreign keys help to ensure referential integrity in the relationship between two tables. This means that the foreign key in any referencing table must always refer to a valid row in the referenced table.
* Relationships Between Tables: Foreign keys enable the creation of relationships between tables (or relations). They can be used to establish various types of data relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
* Data Consistency: By enforcing relationships between tables, foreign keys ensure consistency and accuracy of the data within the database.
* Query Versatility: They allow you to perform complex queries and obtain meaningful results by joining tables on the foreign key.

## Data Engineering Interview Questions & Answers 
### What is data mesh?
Data Mesh is a decentralization paradigm. It decentralizes data ownership, transformation, and delivery. It seeks to remove data processing bottlenecks, allowing component-specific teams to produce and manage their datasets. 

Traditionally, data is treated as a secondary "by-product" and processed by a centralized team. However, this approach can lead to inefficiencies, as these central teams may lack the domain-specific knowledge held by dedicated development teams. Data Mesh aims to address these challenges by distributing data responsibilities more broadly. 

The data mesh paradigm is guided by four principles: domain ownership, domain data as a product, federated computational governance, and self-serve data platform.  *(Jacek Majchrzak et al. (2022). Data Mesh in Action. Manning. Chapter 1)*

### How is data mesh approach different from traditional centralized data architectures?
A data mesh approach differs from traditional centralized data architectures by decentralizing data ownership, transformation, and delivery. While traditional methods treat data as a secondary "by-product" processed by a central team, Data Mesh allows component-specific teams to produce and manage their datasets directly.

The main advantages for large-scale organizations include:
* Efficiency: By distributing data responsibilities, bottlenecks in the data value stream are reduced.
* Domain-specific knowledge: Component-specific teams have a deeper understanding of their domain, leading to more accurate and meaningful data transformations and insights.
* Scalability: By avoiding centralization, organizations can scale their data operations more easily, catering to multiple domains without overloading a single centralized team.
