## SQL & DB Interview Questions & Answers 

### What is the primary key, and why is it important?
A primary key is a special relational database table column (or combination of columns) designated to uniquely identify all table records. It’s important for several reasons:
* Uniqueness: A primary key ensures that each record in the table is unique. This means that no two rows in the table can have the same primary key value.
* Data Integrity: By enforcing uniqueness, primary keys prevent duplicate entries and help to maintain data integrity.
* Relationships: Primary keys are often used to create relationships between tables. For example, a foreign key in one table could reference the primary key in another table, creating a link between the data in both tables.
* Efficient Data Retrieval: Databases are often optimized to search and sort by primary key, making data retrieval operations faster and more efficient.

### How do I choose the right primary key for my table?
Choosing the right primary key for your table is a critical step in database design. Here are some guidelines to help you make the right choice:
* Uniqueness: The primary key field must be unique for each record. It should not contain null values.
* Stability: Choose a primary key that doesn’t change. Updating primary keys can be problematic, especially if they’re used in foreign key relationships.
* Non-sensitive: Primary keys often appear in logs or other external systems, so they shouldn’t be sensitive or private data.
* Relevance: Although it’s tempting to use a field like ‘email’ or ‘username’ as a primary key for a Users table, it’s generally better to use an auto-incrementing ID or similar. This is because fields like ‘email’ or ‘username’ might change, breaking the Stability rule.
